/*
N-th Power
This kata is from check py.checkio.org

You are given an array with positive numbers and a non-negative number N.
You should find the N-th power of the element in the array with the index N.
If N is outside of the array, then return -1.
Don't forget that the first element has the index 0.

Let's look at a few examples:

array = [1, 2, 3, 4] and N = 2, then the result is 3^2 == 9;
array = [1, 2, 3] and N = 3, but N is outside of the array, so the result is -1.

Will the parameters always be an array and a number?
Will the elements in the array always be numbers
Will the return always be a number?

console.log(index([1, 2, 3, 4],2),9);
console.log(index([1, 3, 10, 100],3),1000000);
console.log(index([1, 2],3),-1);
console.log(index([1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1], 9),1);
console.log(index([1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2], 9),512);
console.log(index([29,82,45,10], 3),1000);
console.log(index([6,31], 3),-1);
console.log(index([75,68,35,61,9,36,89,0,30], 10),-1);

//declare variable and assign to arrow function
//if the length of the array is greater than n, return element to the nth power, else return -1
const index = (array, n) => array.length > n ? Math.pow(array[n], n) : -1;
