Two red beads are placed between every two blue beads. There are N blue beads. After looking at the arrangement below work out the number of red beads.

@ @@ @ @@ @ @@ @ @@ @ @@ @

Implement count_red_beads(n) (in PHP count_red_beads($n); in Java, Javascript, TypeScript, C, C++ countRedBeads(n)) so that it returns the number of red beads.
If there are less than 2 blue beads return 0.

Will the argument passed into the function's parameter always be a number?
Will the return always be a number?

console.log(countRedBeads(0), 0);
console.log(countRedBeads(1), 0);
console.log(countRedBeads(3), 4);
console.log(countRedBeads(5), 8);

if n is less than 2 return 0 else return n-1 time 2

const countRedBeads = n => n<2?0:(n-1)*2;
