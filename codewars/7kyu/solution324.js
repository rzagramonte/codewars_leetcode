/*
Speed Control

Given s and x the task is to return as an integer the *floor* of the maximum average speed per hour obtained on the sections of x. If x length is less than or equal to 1 return 0 since the car didn't move.

Example:
With the above data your function gps(s, x) should return 74

Note
With floats it can happen that results depends on the operations order. To calculate hourly speed you can use:

 (3600 * delta_distance) / s.

Will the arguments passed into the function always be a number and an array of numbers?
Will the return always be a number?

console.log(gps(20, [0.0, 0.23, 0.46, 0.69, 0.92, 1.15, 1.38, 1.61]), 41);
console.log(gps(12, [0.0, 0.11, 0.22, 0.33, 0.44, 0.65, 1.08, 1.26, 1.68, 1.89, 2.1, 2.31, 2.52, 3.25]), 219);
console.log(gps(20, [0.0, 0.18, 0.36, 0.54, 0.72, 1.05, 1.26, 1.47, 1.92, 2.16, 2.4, 2.64, 2.88, 3.12, 3.36, 3.6, 3.84]), 80);

TODO:
 iterate over array minus last element
 find average speed at each iteration
 return the largest average speed

const gps = (s, x) => x.length <= 1 ? 0 : Math.max(...x.slice(0, -1).map((e, i) => Math.floor(3600 * (x[i + 1] - e) / s)));
