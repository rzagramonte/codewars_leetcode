Playing with Sets : Equal or Not ?

Set objects are new JavaScript built-in objects defined since ECMAScript 2015

A Set lets you store unique values of any type. It comes with some useful methods like .add, .clear, .has . . . BUT some "Set operations" are missing, like . . .

Equality

Two sets ( A, B ) are considered "equal" if all elements of A are elements of B and all elements of B are elements of A no matter "order" of elements.

Examples:
  {1, 2} == {2, 1}
  {1, 2} != {1, 2, 3}
Task
Create 2 functions, areEqual and notEqual, getting 2 sets as arguments and returning a true or false depending if these 2 sets are "equal" (respectively not equal) ie : if all elements of 1st set are elements of 2d and all elements of 2d set are elements of 1st.

Examples:
A  = new Set([1,2]);
A2 = new Set([2,1]);
B  = new Set([2,3]);

areEqual(A,B)  // -> false
areEqual(A,A2) // -> true
notEqual(A,B)  // -> true

const areEqual = (s1,s2) => s1.size === s2.size && [...s1].every(e => s2.has(e));
const notEqual = (s1,s2) => !areEqual(s1,s2);
