/*
Remove First and Last Character
It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.

Will the parameter always be a string?
Will the return always be a string?

console.log(removeChar('eloquent'), 'loquen');
console.log(removeChar('country'), 'ountr');
console.log(removeChar('person'), 'erso');
console.log(removeChar('place'), 'lac');
console.log(removeChar('ooopsss'), 'oopss');
*/

//declare variable and assign to arrow function
//slice the string from the second character to the second to last character
const removeChar = str => str.slice(1,-1);
