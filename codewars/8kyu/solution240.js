/*
Basic variable assignment

This code should store "codewa.rs" as a variable called name but it's not working. Can you figure out why?

Will the input be three variables, values, and operators?
Will the output be the same as the input but work correctly?

console.log(name, "codewa.rs");
*/

//declare three variables
//assign to values
//use assignment operator
var a = "code";
var b = "wa.rs";
var name = a + b;
