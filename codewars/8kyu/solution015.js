/*
 Description:
Make a simple function called greet that returns the most-famous "hello world!".

Style Points
Sure, this is about as easy as it gets. But how clever can you be to create the most creative hello world you can think of? What is a "hello world" solution you would want to show your friends?

Will there be no parameters?
Will the return be a string?
Will the string read "hello world!"?

console.log(greet(), "hello world!");
*/

//declare variable and assign to arrow function
//return string of "hello world!"
const greet = () => 'hello world!';
