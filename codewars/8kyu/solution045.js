Will the parameter always be a number?
Will the return always be a number?

console.log(century(1705), 18, 'Testing for year 1705');
console.log(century(1900), 19, 'Testing for year 1900');
console.log(century(1601), 17, 'Testing for year 1601');
console.log(century(2000), 20, 'Testing for year 2000');
console.log(century(89), 1, 'Testing for year 89');
