/*
Grasshopper - Variable Assignment Debug

Variable assignment
Fix the variables assigments so that this code stores the string 'devLab' in the variable name.

Will the input be three variables, operators, and values?
Will the output have correct operators to enable assignment?

console.log(a, 'dev);
console.log(b, 'Lab');
console.log(name, 'devLab');
*/

//change loose equality operator to assignment operator
var a = "dev";
var b = "Lab";

var name = a + b;
