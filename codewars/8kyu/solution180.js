/*
Basic Training: Add item to an Array

Add the value "codewars" to the websites array.
After your code executes the websites array should == ["codewars"]

The websites array has already been defined for you using the following code:

var websites = [];

Will there be no parameters?
Will the return be an array with "codewars" as its only element?

console.log(websites,["codewars"]);
*/

// add the value "codewars" to the already defined websites array
//declare websites[0] and assign it to "codewars"
websites[0] = "codewars";
